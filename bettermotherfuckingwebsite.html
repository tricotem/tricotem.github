	<h1>This is <em>Still</em> a motherfucking website.</h1>
	

	<p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>

	<h2>Serously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>
    <h4>fuckingdeclarations.</h4>
	
    <p> That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">grotesque pile of shit</a>into this easy-to-read<br/>ymasterpieece.It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfec-ass<br/>website:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
		<li><em>Still</em> Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
		<li><em>Still</em> Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
		<li>The motherfucker' <em>Still</em> saccessible to every asshole thats visite your site
		<li>Shit's <em>Still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)

	<h3> And guess what,motherfucker:</h3>

     <P> You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site.here's how.</P>

    <h2>Let it breath</h2>

    <p> Looks at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not <br/>married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum<br/> <code>line-height: 1.4 </code>for body copy.Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p>

    <p> If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that?<br/>yes?what a shitty book.

    <h2>A little less contrast</h2>

    <P>Black on white? How oftendo you see that kind of contrast in ral life? Toneit down a<br/>bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so <br/>focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</P>


    <h2>Size matters</h2>

    <p>I know your partners says otherwise, but it's true.Bump that copy to render close to <br/>16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen</p>

    <h2>line-witdh,mothefucker</h3>

    <p>Looking at an LCD screen in stainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's<br/>200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more <br/>than one sentance of your worthless dribble.</p>

    <h3>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h3>

    <p>I love what the creator of <a href=http://motherfuckingwebsite.com>this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so,<br/>simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional<br/>high performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the otherweb<br/>designrs out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
